				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<article>
				Growing up i always enjoyed music, but it soon sparked my interest to delve deeper into the nature of acoustics and also the reproduction of sound through electronic signals.
				<p>At around 16 years old i purchased my first set of technics 1210 mk5g turntables, these kept me up for hours endlessly creating mixes and perfecting them. Playing with vinyl was such a great experience i remember,
				you couldn't help but purchase more each time to open up your track list selection.
				<p>
				Later making music was the next stop, Reason 3.0 was my introduction to the virtual production environment. I enjoyed Reasons concept, you plug cables in at the back of the rack. This concept supported my understanding 
				of signal flow through chains of devices in audio systems. 
				<p>
				Some quotes from my audio lecturer Broady said, "you can't polish a bad audio stream". Its very true with audio, everything in the chain has a consequence and is up to being clean up until the ADC.
